## Engagement Plan for Feb 13, 2026

**Goal:** Build authority and followers in the AI/agents space
**Window:** Next 6-12 hours (act before Feb 14 morning UTC)
**Accounts tracked:** @ycombinator (1.54M), @naval (3.03M), @paulg (2.19M), @a16z (934K)

Below are 7 engagement opportunities ranked by a composite of time-sensitivity, relevance to the AI/agents goal, and expected visibility per reply.

### #1 (URGENT) -- Browser Agents Hackathon by @browser_use

**Link:** [https://x.com/browser_use/status/2022123052059025608](https://x.com/browser_use/status/2022123052059025608)

**Why engage:** This is the single highest-signal, lowest-noise opportunity in the dataset. YC retweeted it (exposing it to 1.54M followers), it is directly in the AI agents space, and the engagement window is wide open. The $100K prize pool and guaranteed YC interview make this a magnet for serious builders. Showing up here positions you as a practitioner, not a commentator.

**Conversation stage:** EARLY OPPORTUNITY. 176 likes, only 14 replies, 160 bookmarks on a 5-hour-old post retweeted by YC. The bookmark-to-like ratio (91%) is extreme -- people are saving this to act on it, not just scrolling past. The reply space is nearly empty. This is the best visibility-per-reply ratio in the entire dataset.

**Best reply angle:** Share a specific, non-obvious insight about browser agent architectures that signals you actually build in this space. Mention a technical challenge or lesson learned, not just enthusiasm. The audience saving this post is builders evaluating whether to participate.

**Draft replies:**

*Option A (Builder credibility):*
> The hardest part of browser agents isn't the automation -- it's handling the 20% of pages that break your DOM assumptions. Dynamic SPAs, shadow DOMs, iframes with different origins. Curious if teams will lean on vision models as a fallback or go pure DOM extraction. Either way, excited to see what comes out of this.

*Option B (Contrarian/provocative):*
> Hot take: the winning project won't be the most technically impressive browser automation. It'll be the one that picks the narrowest, most painful workflow and solves it end to end. "Automate anything" sounds great, but the real money is in automating one specific thing perfectly. What workflows are people targeting?

*Option C (Supportive/community):*
> This is the kind of event the agent ecosystem needs right now -- builders stress-testing browser agents against real-world messiness, not just demos on clean sites. The YC interview guarantee is a brilliant incentive design too. Already thinking about what to build.

**Timing:** Reply NOW. Every hour that passes, more replies stack above yours. At 14 replies, you are almost guaranteed visibility to anyone reading the thread.

**Expected impact:** HIGH. browser_use is a growing account in the agent space. YC's retweet gives this 1.54M-follower amplification. At only 14 replies, your reply will be seen by a disproportionate share of the 14.6K viewers. Likely outcome: 10-50 likes, follow-backs from other agent builders, and positioning as someone who actually works in the space.

### #2 (HIGH) -- Naval: "AI is the great automator"

**Link:** [https://x.com/naval/status/2022224404797960676](https://x.com/naval/status/2022224404797960676)

**Why engage:** Naval's 3M followers are your target audience. This tweet is a philosophical framing of AI that invites practical pushback. 6,713 likes and 596 replies in 16 hours means the thread is very active but not yet saturated. Naval's engagement rate on this tweet is 3.1% (likes/views) -- well above his average, meaning the algorithm is boosting replies. A sharp reply here gets seen by Naval's followers, who skew founder/investor/builder.

**Conversation stage:** PEAK but still viable. 596 replies is a lot, but the tweet is only 16h old and still accumulating at high velocity (engagement velocity score: 18.47, second-highest in the dataset). The 858 bookmarks signal lasting interest. People are still actively reading this thread. Your reply needs a genuinely differentiated angle to cut through.

**Best reply angle:** Naval says AI "must first imitate" before it can automate. Push back or extend this with a practical observation from actually building agents. The thread is full of philosophical takes -- a grounded, builder's perspective will stand out precisely because it is rare in this conversation.

**Draft replies:**

*Option A (Insightful extension):*
> The imitation phase is actually the bottleneck for agent builders right now. The models can reason, but they can't reliably *do* -- click buttons, fill forms, navigate ambiguity. The gap isn't intelligence, it's motor control for the digital world. Automation requires imitation, but imitation requires embodiment, even in software. That's why the agent stack is being rebuilt from the browser up.

*Option B (Contrarian):*
> The part people miss: imitation is not a stepping stone to automation -- it IS the automation. When your AI agent imitates a human workflow well enough, you don't need it to "understand" anything. The question isn't when AI stops imitating and starts thinking. It's when the imitation becomes cheaper than the human. That's already happening in narrow domains.

*Option C (Practical/grounded):*
> Building agents daily, this resonates differently. The imitation fidelity required varies wildly by domain. Support ticket triage? 80% imitation is enough. Code review? You need 98%+ or humans spend more time fixing the agent's mistakes than doing the work. The "great automator" is really a spectrum -- and knowing where on that spectrum your use case sits is the entire game.

**Timing:** Reply within the next 2-3 hours. The thread is 16h old and still growing. After 24h, the algorithm deprioritizes replies to Naval's tweets significantly.

**Expected impact:** MEDIUM-HIGH. At 596 replies, your reply competes with many others, but Naval's audience is highly relevant. If your reply gets 5-10 likes from within the thread, the algorithm surfaces it to more viewers. Realistic outcome: 20-100 likes, visibility to serious AI/tech audience, possible quote-tweet or reply from Naval (he does engage with builder-oriented replies).

### #3 (HIGH) -- Balaji on "AGI may be embodied" via @a16z

**Link:** [https://x.com/a16z/status/2022397513396047938](https://x.com/a16z/status/2022397513396047938)

**Why engage:** Balaji Srinivasan arguing that AGI will be embodied (drones, self-driving, humanoids) is a direct entry point for an AI agents perspective. This tweet has only 20 replies despite 126 likes and 58 bookmarks on a16z's 934K-follower account. The reply field is wide open, and the topic is precisely in your lane.

**Conversation stage:** EARLY OPPORTUNITY. 20 replies on a 5-hour-old post from a16z (934K followers) is extremely low. The bookmark-to-like ratio (46%) signals people find this intellectually interesting and are saving it. The conversation has barely started. You can be one of the first substantive voices in this thread.

**Best reply angle:** Connect Balaji's "embodied AGI" thesis to the software agent world. The claim is that physical interaction with the real world gives embodied systems a data advantage. You can extend this by arguing that software agents interacting with real digital systems (browsers, APIs, codebases) are the digital equivalent of embodiment -- or push back by arguing that language models already have enough world knowledge without physical grounding.

**Draft replies:**

*Option A (Insightful bridge):*
> There's a software parallel to this: AI agents that interact with real production systems -- browsers, APIs, databases -- develop a kind of "digital embodiment." They encounter edge cases, failures, and state that no training dataset captures. The agents that work reliably are the ones that have been ground against reality, not just trained on text. Embodiment isn't just physical.

*Option B (Contrarian):*
> Respectfully disagree with the framing. The bottleneck for AGI isn't sensory data -- it's reliable multi-step reasoning under uncertainty. A drone with perfect vision and no planning ability is a toy. A text-only model that can reliably execute a 50-step workflow is transformative. The embodiment thesis assumes data is the constraint. I think it's architecture.

*Option C (Supportive with nuance):*
> The world model point is key. Every self-driving car and humanoid is building a physics simulator from experience. But the interesting convergence is when those world models feed back into software agents. An AI that has "touched" physical reality through embodied systems may also write better code, plan better workflows, and reason better about cause and effect.

**Timing:** Reply NOW. At only 20 replies and 5 hours old, this is the freshest high-signal opportunity. a16z's algorithm boost window is still fully active.

**Expected impact:** HIGH relative to effort. With only 20 replies, you have a realistic chance of being in the top 5 visible replies on a post seen by 15K+ people. a16z's audience is investors, founders, and senior engineers -- exactly who you want to reach. Realistic outcome: 15-60 likes, meaningful follow-backs from the AI/robotics intersection crowd.

### #4 (HIGH) -- MCP Protocol Gets $6.3M Seed (@mcpuse via @ycombinator)

**Link:** [https://x.com/mcpuse/status/2021952356280414651](https://x.com/mcpuse/status/2021952356280414651)

**Why engage:** MCP is one of your tracked topics. This is the first major funding round specifically targeting MCP infrastructure for AI agents. The 69 bookmarks relative to 122 likes (57% ratio) indicates deep developer interest -- people saving this to reference later. Engaging here builds a relationship with the mcpuse team and positions you as someone paying attention to AI agent infrastructure, not just the application layer.

**Conversation stage:** WINDOW CLOSING but still valuable. 26 hours old, 15 replies, 50.9K views. The engagement velocity has slowed, but the high bookmark rate means people are still discovering this post. A substantive technical reply will get long-tail views because bookmarked threads continue surfacing in recommendations.

**Best reply angle:** Go technical. This audience is developers evaluating MCP for their agent stack. A reply about what MCP infrastructure actually needs -- or what gaps exist in the current MCP tooling landscape -- will resonate far more than congratulations on the raise.

**Draft replies:**

*Option A (Technical/insightful):*
> The timing on this is perfect. The biggest pain point building MCP servers right now isn't the protocol itself -- it's deployment and lifecycle management. Hot-reloading servers, versioning tool schemas without breaking existing agent connections, and observability into what agents are actually calling. If you're solving the ops layer for MCP, that's where the real leverage is.

*Option B (Ecosystem perspective):*
> 6M+ SDK downloads is serious traction. The interesting question is what happens when MCP becomes the default interface between AI agents and external systems. Right now every agent framework rolls its own tool integration. MCP as a universal adapter could do for AI agents what REST did for web services -- but only if the developer experience is significantly better than raw function calling. Rooting for this.

*Option C (Builder question):*
> Congrats on the raise. Genuine question from someone building agents: what's the vision for MCP server discovery? Right now connecting an agent to a new MCP server requires manual configuration. The dream is agents autonomously finding and connecting to the right MCP servers for a given task. Is that on the roadmap, or is human-in-the-loop configuration the design philosophy?

**Timing:** Reply within the next 4-6 hours. The conversation is 26h old but the bookmark-driven long tail makes a thoughtful reply still worthwhile. After 36h, diminishing returns.

**Expected impact:** MEDIUM. The view count (50.9K) is moderate, but the audience quality is exceptional -- this is MCP developers and AI infrastructure builders. Realistic outcome: 5-20 likes, but high-quality follows from exactly the right people. The mcpuse team themselves may reply, opening a direct relationship.

### #5 (MEDIUM) -- Tensol AI: "Full-time AI employees" via @ycombinator

**Link:** [https://x.com/ycombinator/status/2022022899180114020](https://x.com/ycombinator/status/2022022899180114020)

**Why engage:** This YC original tweet (not a RT) about Tensol AI has extraordinary engagement: 830 likes, 137 replies, 825 bookmarks, 243.5K views. The bookmark-to-like ratio is 99% -- nearly 1:1, the highest in the entire dataset. This means people are treating this as a reference document for the "AI employees" thesis. The framing of AI agents as "full-time employees" is a narrative you want to be part of shaping.

**Conversation stage:** PEAK. 137 replies at 19 hours old means this thread is well-populated. However, the 243.5K views and 825 bookmarks mean new readers are still arriving and scrolling through replies. A reply that adds a unique angle can still surface. The key is differentiation -- you need to say something the other 137 replies have not.

**Best reply angle:** Most replies will be either "this is amazing" or "AI can't replace humans." The gap is a nuanced builder's perspective: what actually works in production when you deploy an AI "employee," and what breaks.

**Draft replies:**

*Option A (Practitioner reality check):*
> The shift from "AI copilot" to "AI employee" isn't just marketing -- it requires a fundamentally different architecture. A copilot can be wrong 30% of the time and still be useful. An "employee" running 24/7 with no oversight needs to be right 99%+ of the time, or you need robust error detection and escalation. The companies that nail the error handling, not just the happy path, will win this category.

*Option B (Framework/analytical):*
> The 24/7 angle is underappreciated. A human employee works ~2,000 hours/year. An AI "employee" that handles even simple repetitive workflows runs 8,760 hours/year at near-zero marginal cost. The ROI math is obvious. The real question is: what percentage of "repetitive workflows" are actually repetitive vs. containing edge cases that require judgment? That boundary is where every AI employee product succeeds or fails.

**Timing:** Reply within the next 2-4 hours. At 137 replies, timing matters less than content quality. A great reply posted late can still surface via likes.

**Expected impact:** MEDIUM. High competition (137 replies) but enormous audience (243.5K views, still growing). Realistic outcome: 10-40 likes if the reply is genuinely insightful. The bookmark-heavy audience is builders and decision-makers evaluating this category -- exactly who you want seeing your name.

### #6 (MEDIUM) -- cdixon: Crypto is doing for money what internet did for information (via @a16z)

**Link:** [https://x.com/cdixon/status/2021978913988313120](https://x.com/cdixon/status/2021978913988313120)

**Why engage:** Nobody in this thread is connecting the AI agents angle to the crypto/stablecoin conversation. Both paulg and cdixon are signaling on stablecoins in the same 48-hour window. AI agents need payment rails to operate autonomously -- they need to pay for APIs, purchase resources, transact on behalf of users. Stablecoins are the natural payment layer for autonomous agents because they are programmable and permissionless. This is a genuine insight gap you can fill.

**Conversation stage:** WINDOW CLOSING but angle is fresh. 553 likes, 89 replies, 49.7K views at 30 hours old. The raw numbers are moderate for a cdixon post, but the thread is not overcrowded. More importantly, the AI-payments angle is likely absent from the replies, giving you a unique entry point.

**Best reply angle:** Connect AI agents to crypto payment rails. The thesis: autonomous AI agents operating 24/7 need to transact without human approval for each payment. Traditional payment systems (credit cards, bank transfers) require human identity and authorization. Stablecoins on programmable blockchains let agents pay for services directly, enabling a truly autonomous agent economy.

**Draft replies:**

*Option A (Connecting the dots):*
> The underexplored angle here: AI agents need payment rails too. When an agent autonomously calls APIs, buys compute, or transacts on your behalf 24/7, it can't swipe a credit card. Stablecoins on programmable chains are the natural payment layer for the autonomous agent economy. Crypto didn't just do for money what the internet did for information -- it's about to do for AI what banking did for humans.

*Option B (Specific/technical):*
> This framing becomes concrete when you look at AI agents. We're already seeing protocols like x402 where agents pay for API calls with stablecoins -- no human in the loop, no credit card authorization, just programmatic value transfer. The internet needed HTTP. AI agents need programmable money. That's what stablecoins actually unlock beyond just better savings accounts.

**Timing:** Reply within the next 4-6 hours. At 30 hours old, the window is narrowing but the unique angle compensates. This is worth doing even slightly late because the AI-payments connection is genuinely novel.

**Expected impact:** MEDIUM. cdixon has a large audience that skews crypto-native. The AI angle differentiates you from the typical crypto replies. Realistic outcome: 10-30 likes, visibility to the crypto x AI intersection community, potential cdixon engagement (he does reply to substantive takes that extend his thesis).

### #7 (LOW-MEDIUM) -- Naval: "American AI vs. Chinese Open Source"

**Link:** [https://x.com/naval/status/2021787548104921539](https://x.com/naval/status/2021787548104921539)

**Why engage:** This is Naval's most-engaged AI tweet in the dataset: 21,078 likes, 885 replies, 989K views, 1,356 bookmarks. The topic -- American AI companies talking about wealth-sharing while Chinese companies ship the top open-source models -- sits at the intersection of AI, open source, and geopolitics. This is a "big tent" conversation with Naval's full 3M-follower audience paying attention.

**Conversation stage:** DECLINING. 45 hours old, 885 replies. This thread is crowded. The engagement velocity has slowed. Only engage if you have a genuinely novel, data-backed angle that 884 other people have not offered.

**Best reply angle:** If you engage, do NOT offer a general opinion. The only viable angle at 885 replies is a specific, falsifiable, data-driven claim. For example: which specific open-source agent frameworks are Chinese vs. American, what the actual download/usage metrics are, or a counterexample that complicates Naval's narrative.

**Draft replies:**

*Option A (Data-driven contrarian):*
> This is true for foundation models (Qwen, DeepSeek, Yi) but inverts for the agent layer built on top. LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, browser-use, MCP -- the open-source agent frameworks are overwhelmingly American/Western. The Chinese open-source advantage is in the model weights layer. The application/agent layer is a different story. The question is which layer matters more for the next 5 years.

*Option B (Reframe):*
> Worth separating "open source" into two categories: open weights (Chinese models dominate) vs. open ecosystems (American projects dominate). DeepSeek releases weights but not training infrastructure. American AI companies release less capable models but build open ecosystems (MCP, LangChain, HuggingFace). The American weakness in open weights masks a strength in open tooling. Different games.

**Timing:** Only if you have time after priorities #1-#4. This thread still accumulates views due to its massive engagement, but your reply will be buried under 885 others unless it gets significant independent likes.

**Expected impact:** LOW-MEDIUM. The audience is massive (989K views) but at 885 replies, the probability of your reply surfacing organically is low. If your reply gets 10+ likes from manual engagement (e.g., sharing it in your own network), it can surface to more viewers. Realistic outcome: 5-25 likes unless it catches fire independently.

## Bonus: Original Thread Opportunity

The analysis identified a strong opportunity for an original thread connecting three data points from today:

1. **Exa Instant** -- sub-200ms search engine for AI products (1,221 likes, 841 bookmarks)
2. **Overshoot** -- sub-200ms real-time vision API for video agents (329 likes, 264 bookmarks)
3. **mcpuse** -- $6.3M for MCP infrastructure (122 likes, 69 bookmarks)

**Thread thesis:** "The agent stack is getting fast enough to replace human workflows, and the infrastructure is getting funded to make it real. Three YC companies in 48 hours are building the same thing: sub-200ms inference + standardized agent interfaces. This isn't coincidence -- it's the agent stack crystallizing."

This thread would position you as someone who reads patterns across the ecosystem, not just individual announcements. Tag @ycombinator, @ExaAILabs, @mcpuse, and reference the Tensol "AI employees" framing to maximize cross-pollination.

**When to post:** After completing replies #1-#4. Ideally during US West Coast morning (9-11am PT) for maximum reach.
